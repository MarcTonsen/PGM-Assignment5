Parameter Tuning
We picked sigma as 10 and eta as 0.1. For bigger sigma the images tend to not get denoised at all. For smaller sigma the computed result is very far off from the ground truth image. For smaller values of eta the gradient ascent did not always converge. For bigger values of eta the gradient ascent converged quicker, but the achieved PSNR value of the result was lower.


Initializing gradient ascent with the result of the median filter
According to the PSNR values this approach works better for the artificial videos and worse for the real image. The visual impression for us was mostly an additional slight blur in all cases. In terms of performance the gradient ascent converged slower if we initialized it with the result of the median filter in all cases.
